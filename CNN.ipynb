the diagonal and the pda with ejection fraction her aortic valve area was about her preoperative catheterization given her constellation symptoms and her multiple exacerbations she was admitted the hospital for elective repair her initial examination her weight was pounds pulse sinus rhythm with blood pressure she was otherwise satting room air she was acute distress there was significant jvd her lungs were clear her heart was regular she had iii systolic ejection murmur throughout the precordium her abdomen was otherwise soft she had edema the lower extremities her hematocrit was and her bun and creatinine were and hospital course systems the patient was admitted the hospital and that same day underwent aortic valve replacement with tissue valve and also coronary artery bypass grafting with saphenous vein graft the posterolateral branch the right coronary artery her cardiopulmonary bypass time was minutes and her crossclamp time was minutes the patient was taken the cardiac surgery unit postoperatively neurologically the patient did quite well she had episodes confusion agitation and had adequate pain control with combination narcotic medications the initial postoperative period followed tylenol and ibuprofen needed respiratory the patient respiratory status was quite tenuous during the course her hospitalization she did well initially post extubation postoperative day but postoperative day she began have worsening oxygen saturation with increased work breathing and was found mild respiratory acidosis with hypercarbia her chest film showed bilateral pleural effusions with some evidence chf she was subsequently transferred the intensive care unit for more aggressive monitoring and fact required bipap ventilation her pleural effusions were drained via insertion pigtail catheters she put out significant amount fluid when the pigtails were inserted with approximately coming out from the right chest and another coming out from the left chest when the catheters were inserted her respiratory status stabilized after insertion these catheters and she began improve subsequently after more aggressive diuresis was started the remainder her hospitalization was notable for significant output from the right and left chest tubes per day analysis this fluid revealed transudate without any evidence infective process the drainage catheters were left place for weeks but that time there was only about fluid draining from these catheters and therefore was determined that they should removed she subsequently did reaccumulate some fluid but the effusions were stable and well controlled with diuretics she did not require reintubation postoperatively and her respiratory acidosis did improve the pulmonology critical care service was consulted for assessment these effusions and they felt that these were likely secondary her congestive heart failure they felt that there was evidence amiodarone toxicity contributing her pulmonary status the time her discharge known lastname was satting room air she was otherwise not dyspneic she did have some decreased breath sounds the bases with the presence mild bilateral pleural effusions which had been stable serial chest imaging note there was some question whether these effusions may have been secondary nonspecified postcardiotomy syndrome cardiovascular postoperative day the patient experienced brief runs nonsustained ventricular tachycardia which time amiodarone was started but after the immediate postoperative period these episodes resolved she had been atrial fibrillation the past but fact remained sinus rhythm throughout the course her hospitalization her congestive heart failure was managed with aggressive diuresis and afterload reduction with ace inhibitors there was question whether her pleural effusions were secondary congestive heart failure from problem with her aortic valve for which she underwent repeat echocardiography her repeat echocardiogram showed that her ejection fraction was normal greater than her aortic valve had prosthetic which was seated good position but had somewhat increased gradient present there was mitral regurgitation her aortic valve mean gradient was was not felt that the valve was responsible for her recurrent pleural effusions her chf noted was managed with combination beta blockers and ace inhibitors added calcium channel blockers for some time after consultation with congestive heart failure service but prior her discharge was felt that the combination beta blockade and ace inhibitor alone would adequate for her control along with diuretics she never had any evidence postoperative cardiac ischemia and her bypass graft seemed functioning well prior her discharge noted she was sinus rhythm stable dose beta blocker and ace inhibitor with amiodarone her coumadin was not restarted she had remained sinus rhythm and otherwise not reverted atrial fibrillation and also due the fact that there was concern that there might some risk instability while walking falls while anticoagulation gastrointestinal major issues fluid electrolytes and nutrition the patient was noted significantly volume overloaded the initial postoperative period first she was diuresed aggressively she remained mildly volume overloaded throughout the course her hospitalization for which she was diuresed and off depending upon her renal function the time her discharge had her weight down her preoperative weight was regarding her nutrition the patient albumin was which may have contributed some her edema she was given nutritional supplementation with each meal assist her returning appropriate nutritional status renal the patient baseline creatinine was between which remained throughout most her hospitalization during periods aggressive diuresis her creatinine did bump maximum which time her diuretics were held decreased prior her discharge her bun and creatinine were and she never became anuric and noted her creatinine had normalized prior discharge and she was making adequate volumes urine various combinations diuretics which were used included acetazolamide furosemide and bumex the patient responded best bumex which she had been taking home hematologic the patient did require multiple blood transfusions for her blood loss anemia the immediate postoperative period she responded appropriately each transfusion and had further issues bleeding noted her coumadin was not restarted given the fact that she had been sinus rhythm and also while ambulating one point she had fall where she did hit her head she had neurologic deficit and otherwise lacerations subsequent consequence the fall but given the fact that she may risk for this again was felt that the risks anticoagulation outweighed the benefits infectious disease during her hospitalization the patient had urinary tract infection for which she was treated with bactrim and levofloxacin she otherwise had other infectious complications noted the patient overall hospitalization was focused around management her congestive heart failure and pleural effusions the time her discharge she was doing well she was afebrile with pulse the systolic blood pressure with oxygen saturation room air she was near her preoperative weight preoperative weight her exam was remarkable for sharp systolic ejection murmur and otherwise decreased breath sounds the bases bilaterally she otherwise had edema her lower extremities her bun and creatinine prior discharge were and with bicarbonate her white blood cell count was with

approximately weeks feeling bloated and obstipated with some crampy abdominal pain she had also had some bilious nausea and vomiting her symptoms worsened she sought medical attention several times and finally was evaluated the for acute change the pain initial examination pulse blood pressure respiratory rate satting room air she did not appear any distress she was not jaundice and her sclerae were anicteric she did not have any palpable cervical adenopathy her lungs were clear heart was regular abdomen was distended was tense was notably tender the right percussion with some guarding

ascending colon per pneumatosis coli she also had some right sided hydronephrosis and hydroureter from the distal obstruction and several metastatic liver lesions were noted there were sclerotic metastases the bone present hospital course the patient was admitted and after extensive discussion with the hematology and oncology services was felt that the patient was need exploratory laparotomy and likely colectomy order for relief this obstruction therefore the patient was taken the operating room and underwent total abdominal colectomy with end ileostomy sigmoid colon mucous fistula and omentectomy there was note intraoperative complication excessive blood loss the patient tolerated the procedure well she remained intubated and spent the night the intensive care unit for respiratory support and management fluid status postoperative day the patient was extubated without note difficulty her hematocrit was otherwise stable she was therefore transferred the floor postoperative day postoperative day the patient was notably somewhat tachycardic actually since postoperative day with pulse ranging between and the high this was evaluated and the patient hematocrit was stable and she was maintaining good sats was felt this was secondary combination dehydration and pain therefore she was aggressively rehydrated with lactated ringer and pain control was achieved postoperatively with the use pca postoperative day was apparent that the patient pain was combination acute and chronic pain was felt that the pain management service should involved and therefore they were consulted manage the patient acute chronic pain terms their recommendations they suggested getting her back her oral medications fast possible but the meanwhile that methadone pca would the best choice for her she was started this she did not really respond the methadone pca and required some dilaudid intermittently but postoperative day she was showing evidence bowel activity and therefore was started her pain medications along with some additional vioxx which actually did control her pain otherwise the patient postoperative course was relatively uneventful her tachycardia resolved although she did remain with the pulse between the time her discharge she always maintained stable pressures and only had low grade temp which was thought secondary atelectasis did want schedule mri inpatient evaluate for the extent for bony metastatic disease there may have been some possible way intervene was fact spinal origin but the patient said she was not comfortable with sitting through mri during the hospitalization and therefore was felt that this could done outpatient per her wishes otherwise was noted that the patient did well she was given physical therapy and given instructions regarding stoma was felt that postoperative day this patient was regular diet which she was tolerating without any difficulty and that she had excellent pain control with medications and was ambulating the best

was placed amiodarone the icu and was transferred back the general wards from the icu after her acute renal failure and atrial fibrilliation was rate controlled positive troponins nstemi morning the patient complained vague abdominal pain and ekg was carried out with cardiac enxymes troponin was found positive with index the patient pain resolved with intervention and she was asymptomatic morning rounds with the only complaint weakness her ekg was hard assess for changes given chronic left bundle branch block her vitals remained stable and her troponin remained between heparin drip was started the morning with full dose aspirin with cardiology consult the morning the patient was rate controlled atrial fibrilliation standing metoprolol and amiodarone which was continued during the afternoon the patient went into atrial fibrilliation with rvr and responded pushes metoprolol and diltiazam rate controlled idioventricular rhythym the with and oxygenation the patient was noted unresponsive few hours later for few minutes blood sugars were normal neurological exam was nonfocal abdominal exam benign with distension only insp crackles diffusley was observed vitals were stable including systolic above afebrile without tachycardia the patient became more responsive but still delirious after minutues abg the time showed carbon dioxide retention hypoxemia but was remarkable for lactate the micu was notified the patient however the patient did not meet transfer criteria vitals wise the time the patient was found pulseless the floor code blue was called and she was transferred micu the micu patient initally had pulse but quickly had another cardiac arrest resuscitation efforts were continued for another minutes but ultimately the patient did not have return circulation and she was pronouced dead atrial fibrillation patient was cardioversion here twice during this admission which failed keep her sinus rhythym her inr continued elevated off coumadin for unclear reasons perhaps acute liver failure her lft and were trending down significantly while the floor and she had normal liver ultrasound with patent vasculature continued amiodarone and metoprolol per above acute chronic systolic heart failure her recent was approximately last month however echocrdiogram showed with global hypokinesis and coronary distribution possible causes for the lowered could have been volume overload atrial fibrilliation tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy though this was lower the differential she was volume overloaded with elevated jvd pulmonary edema and lower extremity edema was monitored clinically and admin lasix per above for net goal negative day given and lasix bolus negative rhabdomyolysis her rhabdo was likely related statin myopathy she was supposed stop this

morning neurology recommended myositis panel and emg not done and autoimmune panel including pending tsh was normal transaminitis signs hepatic disease ultrasound the liver with patent vasculature experienced significant trasnaminits which was associated with significant elevated inr was hypotensive report after cardioversion and could have been due ischemic hepatitis with antibiotics poor

signifiant given neurological signs deficits plan was reimage when clinically stable diabetes mellitus type continued insulin micu course through patient admitted the icu for altered mental status and respiratory distress initially this was presumed due flash pulmonary edema she was hypertensive and cxr appeared consistent therefore she was initially diuresed however the morning her urine output was minimal her hematocrit cbc appeared very hemoconcentrated her lactate was rising and her sats were renal was consulted who agreed that the patient was volume deplete and she was given throughout the day well amps bicarb alkalinize the urine even with this amount fluid her sat room air was was hypothesized that the patient aspirated the floor rather than flashed though this unclear the patient creatinine increased from the first day the icu her urine was spun and was consistent with atn the renal consultants felt this was due pre renal azotemia the floor well rhabdomyolysis her trended down from over the first day the icu her creatinine peaked and then started trend down and her urine output increased she also had evidence hypotensive liver injury with some contribution from rhabdomyolysis her ast alt peaked the low and trended down rapidly there was abnormalities her liver synthetic function the patient hematocrit also decreased from after the ivf and bicarb she was guaiac negative this was felt dilutional however her inr was supratherapeutic she was monitored closely for bleeding she did not have flank echymosis repeat hcts were and she had further signs bleeding the patient wbc was arrival the icu from admission and she had fever she had copious diarrhea diff was sent and vanco and flagyl were started empirically diff came back negative but the suspician was still high vanco and flagyl were continued and cipro was added patient listed allergy levofloxacin was upset she had abdomen with contrast only given acute renal failure this showed acute process and signs colitis and more diff were negative cipro flagyl and vanco were stopped she also had blood and urine cultures sent that were negative the patient wbc plateued and she was started vanc aztreonam for rll infiltrate the patient mental status was initially lethargic but after ivf resuscitation improved close her baseline per family however given the acute onset the ams and the patient supratherapeutic inr head was performed and showed acute process neuro was consulted for myopathy and started workup the patient continued have delirium the icu with sundowning and was started standing seroquel and night which helped although the patient reportedly came the hospital nsr she was tachycardic into the consistently was difficult control her rate with dilt metoprolol because her pressures became low she was trialed esmolol drip and this improved her rate into the but this too was limited hypotension she was cardioverted micu day and stayed sinus for about hours before she reverted tachycardia she then had marginal blood pressures and esmolol was tried but stopped cardiology again tried cardioversion and after discussing with liver bolused and loaded with amiodarone she became hypotensive after the cardioversion and central line was placed and the patient started neo with good response she again reverted tachycardia hours later and received more bolus amio and reverted sinus she reverted yet again afib flutter despite being started amio load she was seen cards who recommended diuresis and consult recommended digoxin loaded which improved her rates into low patient was discharged from the icu the hospital where she was noted have mildy elevated troponin and decision was made initiate heparin she continued have intermittent fibrillation the evening before she died she had another episode atrial fibrillation the team rate controlled the atrial fibrillation but approximately hours later she suffered sudden cardiac arrest and was transported back the icu arrived the icu that morning while cpr was progress and had been for prolonged period time despite standard acls the patient did not have rosc and she was pronounced dead

left eye blurriness and left eye pain neurology was consulted and they thought the pain may from migraine vascular phenomenon and less likely intracranial doctor last name they recommended rule out doctor last name infection given his vague symptoms fioricet was started treat his headache day his hospitalziation his headache resolved however hours later his headache returned during doctor last name given the non specific headache was performed after patient ultimately consented first attempt bedside was unsuccessful eventually underwent under fluoroscopic guidance interventional radiology with csf only notable for mildy elevated opening pressure notably had only wbc rbcs and negative culture cryptoccocal ebv and hsv viral pcrs the headache persistently had unclear etiology the leading differential was vasospasm migraine htn related since was more prominent days was decided discontinue his nifedipine and start verapamil verapamil more vasoactive this medication would help vasospasm migraine and htn etiology his headaches persisted despite these interventions pain was consulted and felt that dilaudid may helpful was felt that injection would not helpful given the diffuse nature his headaches fioricet was discontinued did not appear effective any more was continued full dose verapamil and dilaudid prn his htn medication was aggressively uptitrated with the thought this this would help his headaches this moderately controlled his headaches also had severe nausea and vomiting that was controlled with reglan compazine and zofran which was also thought help his headaches was given trial high flow oxygen well case the etiology was cluster headache but this was not successful note the patient was felt quite sensitive opiates and benzos the day his guided received ativan which decreased his and appeared very sleepy also received morphine help control his but also developed decreased and the same sleepiness was not given these medications any more since the etiology his headache was unclear was felt that placing the patient regimen that could take home would the best for him rather than dilaudid pain was consulted was started low dose contin hospital and topomax hospital approximately hours after these medications were started the patient was completely somnolent and responsive sternal rub only was given narcan approximately three times over the course his somnolence and woke briefly remained this state for nearly hours was felt the patient was too much sedating medication causing this deleterious effect all opiates topomax and gabapentin were all was given extra day hopes that this would clear some the medication that has built his system remained hemodynamically stable and protected his airway these medications should started only absolutely necessary and with extreme caution was not given any more sedating medication and only given standing tylenol surprisingly tylenol itself appeared control his headaches the days leading discharge was headache free the last hours his admission truly unclear what the cause his headaches are still speculated that may the cause small studies have demonstrated may cause headaches unclear what the treatment for this also htn headaches did not show clear pattern striking how when his blood pressure ideally controlled his headaches have cleared nevertheless his headaches have resolved for the time being and further follow with his pcp order hypertension his hypertension was most pronounced hemodialysis days with sbps the frequently result his antihypertensive regimen was aggressively increased began take all his anti hypertensives everyday the week including days continued have very high blood pressures after this regimen his medications were increased maximal doses clonidine patch was added weekly continued have episodes sbp the occuring after hospital the setting severe headache was transferred the micu for closer monitoring his micu course was uneventful his blood pressure decreased with hydralazine and labetalol along with taking his medications did not need drip for blood pressure was then started minoxidil bid near the end his hospitalization his blood pressure was lower than expected with levels the low minoxidil was decreased hospital was also noted that was not wearing his clonidine patch for several days the setting well controlled blood pressures after consultation with renal the day discharge his current regimen follows lisinopril daily held the mornings prior valsartan qhs carvedilol bid minoxidil bid held the mornings prior close follow with his highly recommended nausea vomiting this was initially thought due gastroparesis but ges was performed which showed normal motility his were felt secondary his severe headaches his metoclopramide was continued was compazine and zofran times despite these medications continued have nausea and vomiting this proved quite difficult manage his blood pressure would vomit his medication once this was controlled his blood pressure and headaches and eventually his nausea and vomiting improved was discharged metoclopramide tid further evaluation this standing medication should evaluated his pcp his next visit cranial nerve iii palsy diplopia was initially reported further questioning the patient reports his symptoms began after the ophtho exam neuro initially evaluated and feels likely third nerve palsy from diabetes negative besides increased icp optho consulted and confirmed complete palsy the cause diplopia and complete ptosis left eye was felt that this may reversible but not can surgically corrected will follow with neuro optho the outpatient continued home plus hiss was given half his standing dose when not tolerating ckd continued continued sevelamer alone phoslo discontinued neuropathy gabapentin was increased tid initially but when patient became somnolent for several days this medication was discontinued note was very high dose for

interventions were done including the diagonal rotoblated and dilated with angioplasty with residual his left anterior descending had two interventions done for the distal stenosis stent was placed for the stent stenosis angioplasty was done with subsequent brachytherapy after his cardiac catheterization was continued his aspirin and restarted his plavix and integrilin the beta blocker was started once was thought less overt congestive heart failure the plavix was continued for days and the integrilin was continued for hours the seventh day admission was started carvedilol mouth twice day was thought near his dry weight was also started ace inhibitor early the admission captopril when transferred the unit was continued his aspirin and the plavix was discontinued briefly the plavix was restarted the third day the coronary care unit was transferred out the unit was aspirin and plavix and was continued the beta blockade his beta blocker was held initially the setting his hematoma and has been continued will need follow for continuation his plavix for days total pump the patient was overt congestive heart failure based paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea chest ray symptoms ejection fraction echocardiogram the initial interventions were give him furosemide intravenously had been furosemide the past and had been taking mouth once daily was thought that giving him intravenously would definitely cause response was also started digoxin mouth once daily was also started captopril mouth three times day and was uptitrated tolerated beta blocker would started once was compensated his first day diuresed large amount his input was and his output was consequently further lasix was held more gentle diuresis was desired the captopril was increased from and then the second day captopril was increased mouth three times day because was going for cardiac catheterization further active diuresis with lasix was held continued diurese the second day with input and output the third day was more even his captopril was increased had his cardiac catheterization which showed pressure wedge pressure left ventricular pressure area pressure had constantly elevated right sided and left sided pressures had elevated left sided pressure despite being the diuresis his weight had decreased the fourth day admission had come pounds the patient blood pressure was the fourth day admission the sixth day admission the patient had decreased blood pressure the patient had increased wedge pressure but decreased blood pressure initially received normal saline responded and did not have any respiratory complaints thereafter his captopril was held that time was his furosemide however because the patient was considered have increased wedge pressure and was not bleeding from his groin that time further fluids were held was thought that his blood pressure were further decrease may need inotropic support however did not come that had improved review continued lasix the time transition mouth was started once day was receiving lasix after his cardiac catheterization was basically receiving mouth once daily continued have mild diuresis had hypotension the patient the had blood pressures basically between and his carvedilol and lisinopril were continued was decided change his captopril lisinopril and stagger the doses between carvedilol and lisinopril they were given the morning and evening his digoxin was continued the patient was continued some lasix mouth once daily his blood pressure was low between and had increased creatinine the his lasix was held that time lisinopril was continued had much weight loss and was thought that was due his diuresis the the patient required unit blood his hematocrit had decreased required total two units before being transferred the unit was still lasix but was held because increased creatinine his creatinine returned back however had transferred the unit the the day his admission the unit his lasix was held his blood pressure medications were held that time his hematocrit was eventually stabilized and the medications were restarted gradually and gently the diuretic were held but his blood pressure medications were restarted the day admission the day admission was still his zestril and carvedilol and has been continued this was continued his carvedilol and lisinopril this point the patient near euvolemic state and not his lasix will need determined when restart his lasix probably low dose mouth once daily the patient responds fairly well lasix the patient supposed evaluated for biventricular pacing and was thought good candidate for the patient has history atrial fibrillation also had pacemaker placed previously and defibrillator the same day admission had nonsustained ventricular tachycardia consequently the service was called and consulted and pacemaker was interrogated their initial recommendations were that the beat run nonsustained ventricular tachycardia could tolerated and the fact that his defibrillator did not off was good sign and that had more prolonged before should off was detected and charged appropriately and aborted shock appropriately they were concerned about his atrial fibrillation and they suggested cardioversion they also had plans for assessing for biventricular pacing service performed their study the the seventh day admission they further weighed the they recommended anti arrhythmics they initially recommended amiodarone but the patient had history elevated liver function tests consequently they recommended putting the patient dofetilide was started dofetilide the concern with dofetilide was that may prolong intervals however did not suffer these effects had the study the the heparin was discontinued was continued the dofetilide had several things done the patient had ablation done was also assessed for biventricular pacing and was felt good candidate was also cardioverted had biventricular pacemaker mapping had hematoma the left side and pressure was held and was considered stable his blood pressure was stable that time over the next couple days the patient was hypotensive with hematocrit decreased from this was thought due the hematoma but was stable was given two units blood was considered sinus rhythm was continued dofetilide however did not have any profound waves was heparin and coumadin after the procedure his coumadin was given daily bedtime his heparin was goal after his hematoma expanded was stopped the heparin and coumadin heparin and coumadin were restarted the day admission his heparin was started the day admission goal around the patient will have further workup the next month they are awaiting the biventricular pacer defibrillator device approved the fda felt that the patient needs anticoagulation primarily because his risk stroke from his cardiomyopathy and his longstanding atrial fibrillation vascular after the patient had his study developed left sided hematoma was essentially stable for few days the patient had controlled hematoma initially however the day admission the patient was walking around and then developed left flank pain examination had expanding hematoma the left groin had hematocrit drop from the received two units had bedside ultrasound which showed pseudoaneurysm but did show large left hematoma was transferred the unit for further observation pressure was held initially for approximately two hours the hematoma stabilized but was large the left anterior portion his thigh was transferred the unit for observation and had vascular surgery follow him the second day the coronary care unit the patient continued seen vascular surgery was felt that would benefit from surgical intervention went for operation and was found have pseudoaneurysm the profunda femoral artery was repaired and the hematoma was evacuated the patient did not have further interventions the patient had anticoagulation initially held but was restarted once the hematocrits were stable his hematocrit was stable the coronary care unit did receive two units blood prior this large expanding hematoma thereafter did require another two units the goal was keep him above his hematoma still present but his hematocrit stable and the hematoma thought stable had another unit transfused the unit was decided that because his stroke risk that would need anticoagulation and was started the day admission however had done gently endocrine the patient was regular insulin sliding scale and did not really require much mainly diet controlled hematology the patient had decrease his hematocrit initially from the tenth day admission this was thought due his left femoral hematoma from the initial study received one unit blood but his hematocrit did not bump subsequently received another unit did respond that and increased and then subsequently however when suffered the expanding hematoma while walking the day admission his inr that time was and his ptt was his anticoagulation was stopped that time but was restarted the day admission has continued coumadin mouth daily bedtime with goal inr for the indication atrial fibrillation and cardioversion had stable hematocrits the coronary care unit and the time discharge summary had hematocrit renal the patient had creatinine generally stable despite diuresis however the ninth day admission increased had electrolytes done which showed fena less than and urea fairly low too consequently was thought dry and his lasix was held that time did receive some units blood that setting and his creatinine did

disease saphenous vein graft the branch was patent saphenous vein graft first diagonal successful stenting the sequential saphenous vein graft the left anterior descending artery was performed myocardial infarction issues the patient ruled for myocardial infarction with troponin the patient underwent cardiac catheterization and had stent placed the saphenous vein graft the left anterior descending artery the patient was started integrilin drip for hours well lopressor and lisinopril the patient initially did well status post procedure however during the night after the cardiac catheterization the patient again began feeling some anterior chest heaviness the patient stated this was the kind pain for which took nitroglycerin home the patient became hypotensive requiring several fluid boluses and his respiratory examination became significantly worse with increasing crackles his lungs the patient was given one sublingual nitroglycerin and his blood pressure was noted fall into the high likely secondary his aortic stenosis the blood pressure did slowly increase back into the however his respiratory status remained poor the patient was very positive secondary the multiple fluid boluses required continue the patient normotensive therefore the decision was made return the patient catheterization for further intervention during the catheterization the patient was emergently intubated protect his airway the patient had echocardiogram prior catheterization which documented his ejection fraction was now and his aortic stenosis was quite severe well severe mitral regurgitation attempt was made for percutaneous coronary intervention the native obtuse marginal however the procedure was complicated hypotension bradycardia and unresponsiveness stent was placed the native obtuse marginal stated previously the patient was intubated during the catheterization this point the patient was transferred the coronary intensive care unit for further treatment the intensive care unit intra aortic balloon pump was placed augment the patient pump activity the patient was also continued dopamine drip keep his arterial blood pressure great than given the patient did not respond anticipated with history multiple stent placements the decision was made take the patient back the catheterization laboratory for palliative aortic valvuloplasty given the severity his aortic stenosis was thought this was likely contributing the worsening congestive heart failure the aortic valvuloplasty was performed with good results the valve gradient was reduced from the valve area was improved from status post procedure echocardiogram done status post procedure did not document significant improvement the valve area valve gradient therefore was questionable whether the valvuloplasty had lasting impact however the patient clinical status did improve status post the valvuloplasty the patient was slowly weaned off pressors and was extubated after seven days the coronary care unit the patient was transferred back the regular medicine floor the patient was able maintain oxygen saturations greater than room air his ejection fraction status post valvuloplasty was noted approximately once the general medicine floor the patient appeared slightly dry terms his volume status the patient had undergone aggressive diuresis the intensive care unit therefore the patient lasix was decreased mouth once per day initially however overnight the patient became slightly more crackly pulmonary examination and the lasix was increased back mouth twice per day terms his rhythm the patient was initially sinus rhythm with some tachycardia into the was felt this was likely secondary over diuresis however his heart rate had initially been admission the patient diuresis was initially scaled back however this did not affect his heart rate the patient was noted convert from sinus rhythm into some atrial fibrillation however this atrial fibrillation was self limited and the patient converted back normal sinus rhythm however was felt that the patient would likely benefit from long term rhythm control therefore the patient was begun amiodarone loaded with mouth twice per day and then tapered down mouth every day pulmonary issues stated previously presentation the patient was mild congestive heart failure the patient eventually required intubation and was transferred the intensive care unit where the patient required support intra aortic balloon pump the patient was aggressively diuresed for congestive heart failure his pulmonary examination continued improve throughout the remainder his hospital course the regular inpatient medical floor renal issues the patient creatinine was admission was noted have some acute renal failure with his creatinine increasing with decreased cardiac output likely prerenal versus acute tubular necrosis secondary hypoperfusion dye load from multiple cardiac catheterizations his renal function was noted improve and his creatinine was back prior discharge hematologic issues the patient was noted have hematocrit drop during his course the intensive care unit was felt that the hematocrit drop was secondary the multiple procedures through his groin his hematocrit dropped from admission down low the patient hematocrit improved status post transfusion with units packed red blood cells the patient hematocrit was followed keep his hematocrit greater than given the context coronary artery disease the patient stools remained guaiac negative endocrine issues the patient was noted have increased glucose during

after running out her lasix three days prior admission hospital course cardiovascular initially the patient was thought volume overloaded given her chest ray there was clear evidence any cardiac event causing her congestive heart failure normal ejection fraction recent echocardiogram suggesting diastolic heart failure possibly secondary longstanding hypertension and decreased renal function this situation was thought exacerbated her acute chronic renal failure with decreased response diuretics the emergency department she only put out urine intravenous lasix two hours the patient cardiac enzymes were cycled and she ruled out for myocardial infarction her beta blocker was held initially and then restarted after two days she was initially nitroglycerin drip and she was given lasix times one for coronaries she was continued her statin and atenolol the patient was initially placed lasix intravenous and zaroxolyn she was also continued her calcium channel blocker initially for hypertension control echocardiogram showed moderate mitral regurgitation moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy ejection fraction greater than mild left atrial enlargement left ventricle with restrictive filling pattern mild pulmonary hypertension small pericardial effusion because the patient creatinine was continuing rise her lasix and zaroxolyn were both decreased and clonidine was added for blood pressure control the patient had some episodes bradycardia which led unstable blood pressure the beginning her stay eventually the patient was switched back lasix which her home dose her blood pressure control remained poor because her creatinine continued worsen her lasix was discontinued altogether her hypertension improved but her clonidine was titrated further have better control the patient went for her perm cath and arteriovenous fistula for hemodialysis initiation and while she was the operating room was bradycardic the and received atropine she also had pause her electrocardiogram postoperatively her heart rate continued the and and she was hypothermic but her blood pressure was preserved she was transferred the coronary care unit for one night for observation overnight her beta blocker was held was her calcium channel blocker the source the bradycardia was unclear the pacer pads were place but were not used the following day her heart rate improved and she was transferred back out the floor given the fact that hemodialysis was inevitable and ace inhibitor was added her regimen for hypertension low dose beta blocker was restarted the patient tolerated this well lipid panel was checked and was found within normal limits her statin was then discontinued given her elevated alt and ast while she was the coronary care unit she was also ruled out for myocardial infarction although her troponin was slightly elevated probably due renal failure renal the patient presented with acute chronic renal insufficiency this was thought progression her intrinsic renal disease which may secondary her diabetes hypertension maybe secondary prerenal decreased flow renal consultation was requested initially she was diuresed aggressively above renal

she was started clotrimazole troches for this gastrointestinal the patient presented with right upper quadrant tenderness this was thought secondary right sided cardiac congestion liver function tests and alkaline phosphatase were checked and were within normal limits with only mild elevation her alt the patient was protonix the patient was found have elevated alt and ast and hepatitis serologies were sent off because this elevation her statin was discontinued especially since her lipid panel was within normal limits her alkaline phosphatase was also slightly elevated she can evaluated

continued have early morning hypoglycemia despite decrease her nighttime nph initials namepattern last name namepattern consultation was requested who felt that her low blood glucoses may secondary her high nph dose which had not been decreased and which may had stayed longer her system secondary her renal insufficiency insulin cleared renally thus their recommendations were followed and her

furosemide drip titrated urine output greater than hour furosemide drip was increased hour for one day with improvement her urinary output and her overall volume status improved however given the possibility increased ototoxicity these doses nephrology recommended decreasing the rate and starting nitrocor bolus and drip which was done over the next one two days the patient furosemide drip was decreased hour with nitrocor drip accompanying she was also started metolazone augment her renal response furosemide patient had markedly good response this regimen and over the next several hospitalization days diuresed total liters the time this dictation she had symptomatic relief with decreased shortness breath and decreased oxygen requirement the day this dictation nitrocor and furosemide drips were discontinued and the patient maintained furosemide with metolazone scheduled minutes before furosemide this regimen thus far has been adequate maintaining negative fluid balance addition the patient was also started and titrated hydralazine for afterload reduction and oral nitrates for her preload the patient renal function continued improve throughout the hospitalization and

closely with start ace inhibitor post hem onc came and saw patient which time they felt that patient condition was most consistent with reactive thrombocytosis which may also due iron deficiency although the rather abrupt onset the rise the platelet count was not consistent with that they thought that since these are normal platelets the risk thrombosis very low and not concern until the platelet count exceeds they also felt that one issue that those patients with platelet counts this high which over serum potassium level may falsely elevated therefore serum potassium came back elevated they would recommend that this followed with plasma potassium before treating they said they would continue follow patient during her hospitalization postoperative day day eight vancomycin and day five five fluconazole events included atrial fibrillation versus atrial tachycardia overnight started lopressor with low grade temperature physical exam remained unchanged white count stable hematocrit bun creatinine plan was continue lopressor and consider restarting amiodarone continue antibiotics postoperative day anesthesia was called see patient reintubate patient for respiratory distress and confusion patient was reintubated without complications pulmonary came see patient for the reintubation which time they recommended continue pip tazo and vanco obtain sputum for gram stain and culture obtain chest angio planned cycle cardiac enzymes and repeat ekg repeat surface echo and when extubated obtain speech and swallow evaluation for aspiration risk angio the chest was reviewed there was clear consolidation there was large pleural effusion right greater than left and tiny noted the assessment leaned more toward decompensation and chf additional recommendations pulmonary included treating for chf and checking daily weights therapeutic thoracentesis and send the fluid for ldh protein cell count with diff and culture postoperative day hour events included

start tube feeds once stable follow bun and creatinine after dye load continue vanco and zosyn general surgery came see patient which time they stated that they could not rule out calculus cholecystitis they recommended drain the gallbladder with catheter through the liver cholecystostomy tube french was inserted under ultrasound guidance and approximately thin bile was aspirated was sent for culture and sensitivity the plan was leave this for six weeks even stopped draining pulmonary came see patient again which time they recommended decrease fio perform thoracentesis the right

with acute chronic subdural hemorrhage secondary supertherapeutic coumadin and fall hospital course neurological the patient was admitted the medical intensive care unit for neurological checks neurosurgical evaluation and serial head cts due the multiloculated and small size the subdural hematoma which was deemed acute chronic evacuation neurosurgery was deferred although they continued follow closely throughout her admission the subdural hematoma was treated conservatively with decadron reduce brain edema rapid correction the inr with fresh frozen plasma platelet transfusion increase the platelets and keep the level above ddavp correct uremic platelet dysfunction upon presentation the patient neurological exam was nonfocal with question left sided neglect after admission the micu the patient developed more obvious left facial droop and decreased movement the left extremity these neurological symptoms had resolved completely the time discharge the patient was monitored with serial head scans receiving head initially twice day then once per day and then once every other day all these scans showed subdural hemorrhage stable from the time admission the time discharge the subdural hemorrhage continued stable size and appearance the patient was also noted eeg during the admission have evidence epileptiform activity therefore the patient was continued phenytoin throughout the admission with modification the dosing based free phenytoin levels pulmonary after admission the medical intensive care unit the patient became less responsive agitated and tachypneic therefore the patient was intubated and placed propofol drip after the patient status improved the patient was extubated hospital day and transferred the neurological service early the morning after transferring the neurological service the patient became again agitated tachypneic with oxygen saturations down the oxygen via nonrebreather the corresponding abg that time was pco code was called this point and the patient was reintubated and transferred back the micu note the patient had missed her dialysis session the previous day due multiple studies that day addition the patient previous dialysis session had been cut short due studies also that time the patient was over her baseline weight addition the patient had been maintained intravenous fluids after admission the neurological service therefore was felt that the episode respiratory failure was most likely due pulmonary edema the setting volume overload and secondary congestive heart failure with dialysis and careful monitoring volume status the patient improved and was extubated for the second time hospital day after extubation the patient was noted have bulb stridor and wheezing the stridor was treated with racemic epinephrine heliox decadron and discontinuation her ace inhibitor the bronchospasm was responsive albuterol and ipratropium nebulizers addition the beta blocker was discontinued for concern exacerbating bronchospasm after that point the patient wheezing steadily improved and nebulizers were weaned the time discharge the patient was longer wheezing requiring nebulizers heent due the postexpiratory stridor otolaryngological consult was obtained under direct laryngoscopy the patient was observed have erythema and swelling the posterior larynx this was thought consistent with irritation due gastroesophageal reflux disease addition intubation the patient stridor gradually improved and was completely absent the time discharge cardiac following the episode respiratory failure cardiac enzyme levels were obtained and the patient was observed have small increase troponin levels this was thought due cardiac stress the setting volume overload and the possibility contribution from coronary artery disease the patient was started low dose aspirin after consultation with the neurosurgical team the patient blood pressure and rate were controlled with diltiazem infectious disease after admission the micu for the second time the patient was noted have infiltrate chest ray which was thought consistent with aspiration pneumonia therefore the patient was started day course levofloxacin and flagyl the patient was also noted have urinary tract infection for which the patient was covered levofloxacin blood cultures were obtained addition the urine culture both which came back positive for streptococcal bovis given the association streptococcal bovis with pathology addition the patient symptoms gastrointestinal bleeding and history weight loss abdominal pain and bright red blood per rectum there was concern for the possibility source the infection the patient was started ceftriaxone with plan for least week course ceftriaxone cover for the possibility endocarditis especially considering the patient valvular disease with mitral regurgitation tte showed evidence vegetations but tee was declined due inability visualize the upper tract and concern for bleeding with history black emesis gastrointestinal the patient was admitted with history black emesis addition bright red blood per rectum noted above this combination with weight loss abdominal pain streptococcal bovis bacteremia and urinary tract infection raised concern for the possibility gastrointestinal source such colonic malignancy was determined that the patient would need colonoscopy evaluate the lower tract addition egd colonoscopy was negative due concern for risk bleeding these studies were not performed inpatient the plan was follow two three weeks with for colonoscopy and egd renal the patient has end stage renal disease secondary light chain multiple myeloma the patient was continued dialysis three times per week monday wednesday friday during her admission the patient was also started calcium carbonate for decreased calcium levels and high phosphate levels endocrine the patient has history hypothyroidism and being maintained levothyroxine endocrine consult followed the patient during the admission thyroid function tests were obtained prior discharge these showed very low tsh level and low level but these findings were thought unreliable the acute setting was recommended that the thyroid function tests followed outpatient addition due the patient being maintained dexamethasone finger stick blood sugars were obtained daily and the patient was regular insulin sliding scale hematology noted above the patient inr was rapidly corrected with fresh frozen plasma and vitamin upon admission addition the patient low platelet levels were corrected with platelet transfusion presumed uremic platelet dysfunction was treated with ddavp well dialysis all anticoagulation and antiplatelet agents were initially held however addition the patient has significant history graft thrombosis and svc syndrome there was concern for procoagulant risk the patient thalidomide was discontinued for its procoagulant effects addition the patient was started low

patient was doing well but the following morning was found unresponsive and pulseless the house staff the patient was immediately given oxygen and recovered quickly without cardiopulmonary

positive for enterococcus over units the previous head computerized tomography scan was negative chest ray showed possible small infiltrate stress test electrocardiogram was uninterpretable because digoxin therapy his echocardiogram done showed dilated left ventricle decreased left ventricular systolic function with ejection fraction with aortic regurgitation and mitral regurgitation tricuspid regurgitation with some mild pulmonary hypertension all findings which were similar previous echocardiogram carotid duplex showed abnormalities hospital course during the patient admission cardiac care unit serial cardiac enzymes were drawn which time ruled for myocardial infarction with segment elevation the patient was started beta blocker aspirin heparin with ace inhibitor which was held temporarily because his increase creatinine which was thought due his hypotensive episode the patient was then sent the following day for cardiac catheterization which revealed change his coronary artery disease and intervention was done that time the following day the patient was transferred the floor and was found have creatinine that improved that time ace inhibitor was started the following day the patient did well but had some confusion over night and was found have slight decrease urine output with slight rise creatinine the patient had gentle intravenous hydration the case manager was consulted that time well physical therapy the patient foley catheter was discontinued the following day the patient did well over night with confusion noted the patient did urinate some dark red urine which was thought related trauma from his foley catheter was also decided that time that the patient should cardioverted for his atrial fibrillation that his biventricular pacer could function more efficiently was also decided that time that the patient should continue anticoagulation with coumadin after his discharge from the hospital because the future risk atrial fibrillation and history stroke the following day the patient did well had somewhat decreased urine output which was red thought secondary his foley catheter which had since been removed the patient had chest ray which showed

glucose had decreased her arterial blood gas had pco she was converted from insulin drip regular insulin sliding scale she was continued with fluid hydration she longer had any free water boluses she was transferred out the medical intensive care unit the fourth day admission was felt that her glucose may have been elevated secondary dexamethasone and possible infection she did not have any further episodes hyperglycemia she was started glipizide she had better control with the glipizide her insulin was adjusted for better coverage and was increased according needs her fingersticks were stopped once palliative care had been decided neurologic system the patient had seizures thought secondary metabolic derangement she was seen the neurology service and started dilantin was felt that she likely had seizure due hyperglycemia hyponatremia she did not have any further episodes seizures during the course this admission her mental status did wax and wane but essentially improved from admission she did not have any intracranial lesions however she could not tolerate magnetic resonance imaging and was unable fully excluded she did have electroencephalogram assess for any seizure focus and that also did not show any conclusive evidence for seizure the electroencephalogram had suggested possible left focal cortical abnormalities she was continued oral dilantin the electroencephalogram had suggested left temporal focus but since the scan did not show any evidence was further pursued she could not tolerate magnetic resonance imaging she had repeat electroencephalogram which did not show any focal slowing unlikely having ongoing seizures with the report and repeat magnetic resonance imaging was not able performed infectious disease the patient had fever her first day admission subsequently she had lumbar puncture done chest ray was suggestive possible left lower lobe pneumonia she was started levofloxacin she had lumbar puncture done she was started ceftriaxone meningitis dose initially the cerebrospinal fluid did not show any polymorphonuclear cells did not show any organisms showed white blood cells with polymorphonuclear leukocytes the glucose was and protein was was felt that the low volume may have been from aspiration vomiting during seizure consequently flagyl dose was started ceftriaxone was continued for course days was

her hyperglycemia was found that she had some nodular masses her abdomen dermatology was consulted and biopsy was taken was found consistent with plasmacytoma extension her multiple myeloma was felt that her diffuse tumor burden was increasing despite the chemotherapy that she had been receiving she also had peripancreatic mass which was most likely part this similar condition there was some discussion whether biopsy this mass however she never was stable enough for biopsy cardiovascular system the patient had multiple episodes dyspnea during the course this admission was felt that given her history congestive heart failure that she likely had congestive heart failure she was given lasix periodically she had some improvement with the lasix she had persistent tachycardia during the course this admission and was felt due possible dehydration she received fluids and also with her history congestive heart failure she was continued lasix once per day with metoprolol she was also started captopril and was increased tolerated renal system the patient had increasing creatinine her initial admission however her creatinine improved with some fluid hydration was felt prerenal however her urine output throughout the course this admission was felt poor she would receive fluid intermittently with occasional response fluids because her history congestive heart failure the fluid intake was gently given pulmonary system the patient had episodes dyspnea during the course this admission the possible etiologies were pneumonia tumor burden along with congestive heart failure she was treated antibiotics and occasional lasix however was felt that she had other causes that were more likely than pulmonary embolism she did not receive angiogram during the course this admission gastrointestinal system the patient had episode melena during the course this admission she was evaluated gastroenterology because her poor prognosis she was not candidate for interventional studies she had guaiac positive stool and decrease hematocrit she was given units packed red blood cells needed because the deterioration her condition and move toward hospice care was decided hold off the
